The year of 1998 was announced by UNESCO the Year of Pushkin.
In this way the mankind paid tribute to the genius of the Russian literature in commemoration of his 200th anniversary, 
which was celebrated world wide in June 1999.
A. Pushkin was a Russian poet, novelist, dramatist, and short-story writer.
He is considered his country’s greatest poet and the founder of modern Russian literature.
He is the author of «Yevgeny Onegin», «little Tragedies», «The Queen of Spades», «Boris Godunov» and wonderful verses and fairy tales.
We have grown up with his learned cat, who walked round and round the oak-tree, singing songs as he circled right,
and telling tales as he circled left. We were fond of his exiled Prince,
who was turned into a bumble-bee so that he could fly to his father’s court and sting his wicked aunt on the nose.
Later we experienced Onegin’s boredom, Tatiana’s unrequited love, Godunov’s uneasy conscience,
Herman’s tension at the gaming table, Saliere’s jealousy of Mozart,
and heard the dead steps of the Stone Guest and the thundering hooves of the Bronze Horseman.
